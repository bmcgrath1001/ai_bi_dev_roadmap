# 🧠 Teaching ChatGPT Your Data: Best Practices

This guide outlines how to safely and effectively give ChatGPT context about your data lake, table schemas, and pipeline logic — without sharing credentials or exposing sensitive data.

The goal is to treat ChatGPT like a secure, high-context **AI pair programmer** who can reason with structure, metadata, and business meaning.

## ✅ Phase 1: Teach the Shape of the Data

### A. Share Schema Extracts

Use SQL to generate table structure:

```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM snap_analytics.snapdata.customer_account;
```

Or via information_schema:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'snapdata' 
  AND table_name = 'customer_account';
```

Paste the result into ChatGPT along with your goal:

> “Here’s the schema for `customer_account`. Help me write cleaning logic or build a dbt model for it.”

📁 You can also version this in your repo as:

00_foundations/schemas/customer_account.md

### 🧠 B. Add Business Meaning

Include semantic info ChatGPT can reason with:

> “The `fraud_flag` in `customer_application` marks apps auto-flagged by rules.  
> Final verdicts come from `fraud_investigation_outcomes`.”

This helps with:
- Feature engineering  
- Cohort tracking  
- Dashboard metrics alignment

## 📘 Phase 2: Build a Data Dictionary

Already working in Excel or Markdown? Upload it directly.

ChatGPT can help you:
- Autogenerate field descriptions  
- Flag inconsistent naming or logic  
- Suggest validation or cleaning rules  

Keep it lightweight or modular:

## 🔗 Phase 3: Simulate Workflow Access

ChatGPT can’t directly query S3 or Trino — but you can simulate access by pasting context:

| **Task**              | **How to Give Context**                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Query optimization    | Paste SQL + platform (Trino, Postgres, etc.)                         |
| Pipeline review       | Paste DAG logic or Airflow `.py` task                                |
| Debugging help        | Paste error + code snippet                                           |
| Performance tuning    | Mention volume, filter columns, and partition strategy               |
| ETL logic generation  | Describe the source → staging → curated path                         |
