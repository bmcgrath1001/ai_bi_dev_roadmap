# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Fundamentals for BI Developers

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing means using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, instead of using a local server or personal computer.

## Key Benefits
- Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pricing reduces upfront costs.
- Accessibility: Access your infrastructure and data from anywhere.
- Reliability: Redundancy and backup solutions increase uptime.

## Major Cloud Providers
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Microsoft Azure**

## Common Services (especially for data work)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage
- RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed Postgres/MySQL/etc.
- Redshift / BigQuery / Synapse: Data warehousing
- Lambda / Cloud Functions: Serverless code execution

## Why It Matters for BI & Data Engineering
- Data is often stored in cloud warehouses (e.g. Redshift, BigQuery).
- You‚Äôll need to know how data flows from transactional systems into cloud storage and eventually into reporting tools like dashboards.
- Cloud services power ETL pipelines, Airflow workflows, and streaming systems.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Look at your company‚Äôs cloud provider.
- [ ] Find out where your team's data is stored (e.g., S3, Redshift).
- [ ] Note any terminology or services you don‚Äôt understand ‚Äî bring them here!
