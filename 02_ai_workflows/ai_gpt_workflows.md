# 🔄 AI + GPT Workflows

This guide outlines practical workflows where ChatGPT (or similar LLMs) enhances and accelerates tasks across BI, fraud analytics, data engineering, and strategic development — not just through prompting, but by embedding AI into repeatable daily flows.

## 🧠 Workflow: SQL Development Assistant

**Goal**: Accelerate writing, testing, and refactoring SQL queries

**Steps**:
1. Paste table schema or use: “This table tracks transactions with columns X, Y, Z...”
2. Prompt: “Write a query that aggregates by month and filters invalid amounts.”
3. Use follow-up prompts for refactoring:
   - “Convert to CTEs”
   - “Add a time zone conversion”
   - “Optimize for partition pruning”

**Toolchain**: ChatGPT + VS Code + Trino/Postgres

## 🧼 Workflow: Data Cleaning & Profiling

**Goal**: Use LLMs to audit, clean, and validate datasets

**Steps**:
1. Paste sample rows or describe data layout  
2. Prompt: “Suggest data quality checks and validation rules for this dataset.”  
3. Use: “Now write a Pandas function to clean missing values and outliers.”  
4. Follow-up: “Write test cases for this cleaning logic.”

**Toolchain**: ChatGPT + Pandas/Polars + dbt or Pytest

## 📊 Workflow: Dashboard Building

**Goal**: Use GPT to scaffold dashboard layouts and code

**Steps**:
1. Describe the metrics or KPIs you're visualizing  
2. Prompt: “Suggest a layout for a Streamlit dashboard showing X, Y, Z metrics.”  
3. Add: “Now write the Streamlit code block with dummy data.”  
4. Follow-up: “Make it responsive with 2 columns and a filter menu.”

**Toolchain**: ChatGPT + Streamlit + Python

## 🐛 Workflow: Debugging and Log Interpretation

**Goal**: Reduce time spent deciphering errors

**Steps**:
1. Paste full traceback or SQL error  
2. Prompt: “Explain this error and how to fix it.”  
3. Use follow-up: “Why would this fail in Airflow but work locally?”  
4. Add: “Now write test cases to prevent this issue.”

**Toolchain**: ChatGPT + Airflow Logs + dbt debug output

## 🧪 Workflow: Test Writing

**Goal**: Generate tests for SQL models, Python functions, or data flows

**Steps**:
1. Prompt: “Write tests to ensure `account_id` is unique and never null.”
2. For dbt: “Write a schema.yml test block for `is_active` and `account_status`.”
3. For Python: “Generate `pytest` tests to validate transformation logic.”

**Toolchain**: ChatGPT + dbt + Pytest + Great Expectations

## 📄 Workflow: Auto-Documenting Projects

**Goal**: Automatically generate markdown docs from code, queries, or outputs

**Steps**:
1. Paste SQL or Python code block  
2. Prompt: “Summarize what this model does and its dependencies.”  
3. Follow-up: “Now write a README section for this DAG.”

**Toolchain**: ChatGPT + GitHub + Markdown editor

## 🤖 Workflow: Prompt Automation Patterns

**Goal**: Chain prompts to create reusable workflows

**Examples**:
- SQL generation → test generation → doc generation  
- Streamlit layout → code scaffold → bug fix → UX improvement  
- Schema profiling → cleaning → validation → anomaly detection

Use ChatGPT like a pair programmer that improves across iterations.

## 🧠 Tips for Creating GPT Workflows

- Always begin with clear context (table shape, goals, toolset)
- Chain prompts from “generate” → “refine” → “test” → “document”
- Use prompt templates or snippets in VS Code, Notion, or ChatGPT custom instructions
- Pair AI workflows with version control and validation layers
